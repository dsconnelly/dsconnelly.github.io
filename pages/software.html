<p>I maintain a few small Python packages.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://pypi.org/project/mubofo/">mubofo</a> implements
        boosted forest regression models that natively support multioutput
        problems. At present, it's reasonably performant, but a long-term goal
        of mine is to speed it up by rewriting the backend entirely in C.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://pypi.org/project/func2cli/">func2cli</a> allows
        automatic generation of command line interfaces of Python scripts,
        provided the functions they call have appropriately formatted 
        docstrings.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    In addition, I'm the creator of <a href="https://dsconnelly.github.io/escucho/">Escucho</a>, a simple web application that lets you practice transcribing Spanish-language audio. More features and more languages to come!
