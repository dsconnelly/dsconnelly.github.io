    I prepared notes on several subjects while studying for my oral qualifying
    exams. I make them available on the off chance they are useful to others.

<ul>
    <li><a href="notes/pde.pdf">partial differential equations</a></li>
    <li><a href="notes/numerical.pdf">numerical analysis</a></li>
    <li><a href="notes/optimization.pdf">optimization</a></li>
    <li><a href="notes/atmo.pdf">atmospheric dynamics</a></li>
    <li><a href="notes/climate.pdf">climate dynamics</a></li>
</ul>

    I cannot claim that they are entirely free of errors, but I believe
    them to be largely correct. Feel free to email me should you find any major 
    mistakes.
