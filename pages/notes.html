<p>
    I prepared notes on several subjects while studying for my oral qualifying
    exams. I make them available on the off chance some future reader finds them
    useful. While I cannot claim that these notes are entirely free of errors, I
    believe them to be largely correct. Feel free to email me should you find
    any major mistakes.
