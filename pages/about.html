    I'm a PhD student at the <a href="https://caos.cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/">
    Center for Atmosphere Ocean Science</a>, part of the 
    <a href="https://cims.nyu.edu">Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences</a>
    at New York University. My advisor is 
    <a href="https://edwinpgerber.github.io/">Edwin Gerber</a>.
</p>

<p>
    I'm interested in exploring how our understanding of (geo)physical systems
    and the (partial differential) equations that govern them can be integrated
    with machine learning methods to build better models. Currently, I'm working
    on the <a href="https://datawaveproject.github.io/">DataWave</a> project,
    developing data-driven parameterizations of atmospheric gravity wave drag
    for use in climate models.

    Before coming to Courant, I received my undergraduate degree in mathematics
    from Cornell, where I also completed minors in atmospheric science and
    French. For three years, I was an undergraduate research assisant in
    <a href="https://mahowaldresearchgroup.eas.cornell.edu/">Natalie Mahowald's
    group</a>, studying observations and Earth system model representations of
    atmospheric aerosols.

    During the summers of 2019 and 2020, I interned at the NASA Jet Propulsion
    Laboratory, where I worked with
    <a href="https://www.davidraythompson.com/">David R. Thompson</a> (and many 
    others) on uncertainty quantification for the
    <a href="https://earth.jpl.nasa.gov/emit/">EMIT mission</a>. Our paper in
    <i>Remote Sensing of Environment</i> on that project can be found
    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2021.112380">here</a>.

    Outside of academic life, I'm a musician, a <a href="images/blueberry.jpg">
    baker</a>, and an avid soccer fan. I'm also fascinated by linguistics, 
    espcially phonetics and historical reconstruction.
